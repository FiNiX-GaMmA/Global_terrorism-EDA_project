coded and analysed by **@Aryaroop Majumder**
### Problem Statement

**Global terrorism** is described as the activities involving violence and crime with the intention to promote religious or political ideologies across the world. Global terrorism mainly consists of violence, threats and intimidation for pressurizing the government, International group or community in general.
Global Terrorism is a serious threat to the international community. Including, western individuals travelling or living abroad overseas and a substantial threat to indigenous individuals located near, or within unstable regions or areas of terrorist activity.

Globally, every region has recorded a higher average impact of terrorism in recent years than the early 2000s. The increase in the impact of terrorism was greatest felt in the _Middle East and North Africa, followed by sub-Saharan Africa._

There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally, especially against western interests and nationals from groups, or individuals motivated by the recent conflicts in these areas.
### What this project requires me to do

As a security/defense analyst, I will try to do the following:- 

- Exploratory data analysis
- Try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. 
- Handle the missing value 
- Do compare the various regionâ€¦. visualize it and showing it on global map would be better to understand.
